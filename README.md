# MindTheWord

An extension for Google Chrome that helps people learn new languages while they browse the web.

MindTheWord helps the user to easily learn the vocabulary of a new language
while browsing pages in his native language. In every web page visited, it
randomly translates a few words into the language he would like to learn.
Since only a few words are translated, it is easy to infer their meaning from
the context.

## Installation:

1. `npm install -g ionic cordova`
2. `npm install -g jspm gulp`
3. `npm install`
4. `jspm install`
5. Read the installation and platform [guidelines](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/guide/platforms/android/)
6. `ionic lab` - Start a local dev server for app dev/testing

6. `ionic build android` - To build Android APK
